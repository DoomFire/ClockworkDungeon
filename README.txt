~~~~~~~~~~] IDEAS [~~~~~~~~~~

Feel free to add anything you think of to the list, so we can all discuss it and go over how we might implement things.

Player spawned Automatons:
         - Automaton dropper will spawn player side automatons when placed by the player.
           Only a single automaton can be spawned at a time. and will remain in the vacinity of the spawner
         - Perhaps return to the spawner after a certain time idle (?)
         - could easily be linked to an in-game motion sensor to come out when monsters are around, automtatically.
